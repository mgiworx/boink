Boink
=====

_Wonderful WordPress theme_

Boink is a custom theme, flexible through lots of options using the core customizer,
fully compatible with Gutenberg.

It is minimalist, focusing on content, also allowing the user to select from different
color palets, alternative headers and footer styles.

It tries to be that theme that you just wished there was.

This repository is for anybody interested in participating in development and
fixing bugs. No _how to use_ it *support* is offered here!
